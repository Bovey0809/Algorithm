# Testcase Example:  '["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]'
#
# Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.
#
# The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the
# original array.
#
# Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.
#
# After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length
# of the array.
#
#
# Follow up:
# Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input:
# ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
#
# Output:
# Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be:
# ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
#
# Explanation:
# "aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by
# "c3".
#
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input:
# ["a"]
#
# Output:
# Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]
#
# Explanation:
# Nothing is replaced.
#
#
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input:
# ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
#
# Output:
# Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be:
# ["a","b","1","2"].
#
# Explanation:
# Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb"
# is replaced by "b12".
# Notice each digit has it's own entry in tÂ¯he array.
#
#
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# All characters have an ASCII value in [35, 126].
# 1 <= len(chars) <= 1000.
